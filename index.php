  1) Also, I thought of some other things to mention.  Under present Virginia agency law, the full name and address of RE/MAX Performance Realty and the words "licensed in the State of Virginia" need to be on every page or within one click of every page.  (you might want to check Larry's Overbrook site, that might need updating to be legal on that?).

  2) I think that under community resources we mentioned EMU, EMHS, Morrison Park, and Red Front Supermarket.  It would also be good to have Virginia Mennonite Retirement Community.  It is within walking distance offers a lot of community resources including a wellness center, etc.

  3) The house could have a label something like:  First house built in Parkhill Subdivision; sold quickly after completion!
